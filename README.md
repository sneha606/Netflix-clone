Netflix Clone
This project is a frontend clone of Netflix, built using HTML and CSS to replicate the design and layout of the original platform. It includes a fully responsive homepage, a modern UI with a hero section, movie categories, and a structured grid layout to showcase content. The goal of this project is to practice frontend development and improve CSS styling techniques.

ðŸš€ Current Status: The project is fully functional with HTML and CSS. JavaScript and React will be added later to enhance interactivity, such as video previews, dynamic content loading, and user authentication.

Future updates will include animations, hover effects, and backend integration to improve the overall experience and make the project more dynamic. Stay tuned for further improvements! ðŸŽ¬ðŸ”¥
